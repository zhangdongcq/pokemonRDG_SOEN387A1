1: mtldong_387A1.sql can initialize the database with empty tables.
2: The fastjson-1.2.51.jar should be build in path in order to work with Json parse. You could find the jar in web content/Web-INF/lib package.
3: All test cases passed with given testsuite. I will present the demo if any case failure.
Thank you.
